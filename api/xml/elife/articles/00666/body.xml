            <p>This article is a guide to the tagging and display of eLife articles and will
                encompass all the elements that can possibly be contained in an eLife article. It
                will also include information from the author guide. For this reason, it is
                colloquially known as the eLife 'kitchen sink'.</p>

                <title>The eLife editorial process (level 2 heading)</title>
                <content>
                    <p>eLife publishes the most highly influential research across the life sciences
                        and biomedicine. Before you submit your work, please note that eLife is a
                        very selective journal that aims to publish work of the highest scientific
                        standards and importance. Leading academic researchers evaluate new
                        submissions and approximately two-thirds are returned to the authors without
                        further peer review. See <a href="#bib12">DeLano, 2002</a> and <a
                            href="#bib13"> Department of Education and Morgan, 2016</a>.
                        Approximately half of the articles that are selected for peer review go on
                        to be published (<a href="#bib5">Brettar et al., 2004a</a>). If other
                        researchers publish similar findings after submission, this will not be a
                        reason for rejection. The eLife editorial process broadly occurs in three
                        phases (<a href="#bib48">Turlings and Wäckers, 2004a</a>; <a href="#bib49"
                            >Turlings and Wäckers, 2004b</a>; <a href="#bib51"> Wolski et al.,
                            2008</a>; <a href="#bib50">Walker, 1994</a>; <a href="#bib44">Tanaka et
                            al., 2016</a>). If you are interested in submitting your work to eLife,
                        please review the guidelines relating to initial submissions. If you have
                        received an encouraging response to your initial submission, please review
                        the guidelines relating to full submissions. If your full submission has
                        been peer reviewed and you have been asked to make revisions, please review
                        our guidelines for revised submissions (<a href="#bib6">Brettar et al.,
                            2004b</a>).</p>

                            <p>eLife publishes research of the very highest (<a href="#bib7"
                                    >Bricogne et al., 2011</a>) standard and significance, so many
                                manuscripts are returned to the authors without in-depth peer
                                review. During the initial submission phase, members of eLife’s
                                senior editorial team rapidly assess new submissions, often in
                                consultation with members of the Board of Reviewing Editors or with
                                external guest editors where necessary, to identify the ones that
                                are appropriate for in-depth peer review (<a href="#bib8">Cardé and
                                    Millar, 2004</a>; <a href="#bib9">Cartwright, 2016</a>; <a
                                    href="#bib10">Chmeil, 2008</a>). To simplify the submission
                                process, authors should submit their full manuscript as a single
                                PDF. Limited additional information is collected via the submission
                                screen questions to complete the submission (<a href="#bib6">Brettar
                                    et al., 2004b</a>).</p>

                                    <p>A discrete three-dimensional model space was generated

                                        left), with dimensions corresponding to population &#x00B5;,
                                        population &#x03C3;, and f value. Any given value in the
                                        matrix indicates P(f|&#x03BC;,&#x03C3;), that&#x00A0;is, the

                                        constitute the forward model (by which stimuli are

                                        particular f value, yielding a two-dimensional probability
                                        distribution for the hidden parameters (<a href="#fig2s1"

                                        Steps 3-6 were then worked through for each stimulus segment
                                        in order, starting at the beginning of the stimulus.</p>

                                        later), were multiplied together, and scaled to a sum of 1.
                                        The resulting probability distribution (<a href="#fig2s1"

                                        thus reflects parameter probabilities taking into account

                                    <p>This combined parameter probability distribution was then
                                        scalar multiplied with the full model space, in order to
                                        weight each of the forward model columns (each corresponding
                                        to a particular parameter combination) by the probability of
                                        that parameter combination being in effect. The resulting
                                        weighted model space was then averaged across parameter
                                        dimensions, to yield a one-dimensional (forward) probability
                                        distribution, constituting an optimal prediction about the f
                                        value of the next stimulus segment, provided a population
                                        change did not occur before then. A probability distribution
                                        applicable if a population change were to occur was
                                        calculated the same way, but without weighting the forward
                                        model columns (so as to encompass every possible parameter
                                        combination).</p>

                                    <p>It was assumed that a population change occurred immediately
                                        prior to the first stimulus segment. To infer subsequent
                                        population changes, for each segment the probability of
                                        observing the present f value was compared for the two
                                        probability distributions (the distribution assuming a
                                        population change, and the distribution assuming no change),
                                        that&#x00A0;is, P(f|c) and P(f|&#x007E;c), respectively,
                                        with c denoting a population change. The probabilities were
                                        compared, in conjunction with the known prior probability of
                                        a population change (1/8), using Bayes&#x2019; rule, as

                                    <p>For each segment, the above calculation of P(c|f) was made
                                        not only with respect to the immediately preceding segment,
                                        but also a number of segments preceding that, up to a
                                        maximum of 4. Therefore, for segment t, it was possible to
                                        conclude that a population change had occurred immediately
                                        prior to t, t-1, t-2, t-3, or none of the above. A
                                        population change was judged to have occurred at the time
                                        point with the highest value of P(c|f), provided this value
                                        was greater than 0.5. Using more than 4 lags did not
                                        appreciably alter the estimates obtained by model inversion.
                                        Importantly, any retrospective inference of population
                                        changes did not retrospectively alter any prior predictions
                                        generated by the model (e.g. at time t, if a population
                                        change were inferred to have occurred at time t-3 then the
                                        priors for t-2, t-1 and t were not affected, but only the
                                        priors for t+1 onwards).</p>

                                    <p>Once the above steps were worked through for each stimulus
                                        segment in order, the optimal prior predictions were used to
                                        calculate the perceptual inference variables of interest.
                                        Predictions themselves were summarised by their mean
                                        (&#x03BC;) and precision (1/variance). Changes to
                                        predictions (&#x0394;&#x00B5;) were calculated as the
                                        absolute change (in octaves) in &#x03BC; from one prediction
                                        to the next. Surprise (S) was calculated as the negative log
                                        probability of the observed f value given the prior
                                        prediction, and prediction error (irrespective of prediction
                                        precision) was calculated as the absolute difference (in
                                        octaves) between the observed f value and the mean of the
                                        prior prediction. Mathematically, surprise is directly
                                        proportional to prediction precision multiplied by
                                        prediction error. Finally, &#x0394;f was calculated as the
                                        absolute difference between the current and preceding value
                                        of f.</p>

                    <p> We propose a Bayesian scheme for BCV (see <a href="#equ1">equation 1</a>)
                        that accommodates the influence of context on incentive value. BCV focuses
                        on scenarios (i) where incentive value depends on contextual information
                        (either represented by cues or by previous rewards) provided before options
                        or rewards are presented, and (ii) where reward is defined by a single
                        attribute (e.g., reward amount). To describe the basic principles of BCV, we
                        adopt the formalism of Bayesian graphs ( <a href="#bib47">The
                                <i>Shigella</i> Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2015c</a>) where a
                        generative model is described by nodes or circles, representing random
                        variables (shaded and white circles refer to observed and non-observed
                        variables respectively), and arrows, representing causal relationships among
                        variables. A simple generative model hypothesized by BCV is shown in Figure
                        1A of another article (not linked here), where C represents prior beliefs
                        about the average reward expected in a given context. Formally, this
                        corresponds to a (Gaussian) prior belief (with mean <mml:math>

        <content>
            <p>The function of the Discussion is to interpret your results in light of what was
                already known about the subject of the investigation, and to explain our new
                understanding of the problem after taking your results into consideration. The
                Discussion will always connect to the Introduction by way of the question(s) or
                hypotheses you posed and the literature you cited, but it does not simply repeat or
                rearrange the Introduction. Instead, it tells how your study has moved us forward
                from the place you left us at the end of the Introduction (<a href="#bib38"

            <p>In some cases, authors will include extremely long gene sequences or other letter
                strings that need to be enclosed withing a particular style tagging in order that
                they can be wrapped on the final HTML display. If this tagging is not included, the
                strings will likely spill across the edge of the text column, which can look very
                messy, not to mention rather silly:
                    <elife:sequence>TAATAAGGAAGAACTGCTTATTCTTAATTATTTCTACCTACTAAACTAACTAATTATCAACAAATATCATCTATTTAATAGTATATCATCACATGCGGTGTAAGAGGATGACATAAAGATTGAGAAACAGTCATCCAGTCTAATGGAAGCTCAAATGCAAGGGCTGATAATGTAATAGGATAATGAATGACAACGTATAAAAGGAAAGAAGATAAAGCAATATTATTTTGTAGAATTATCGATTCCCTTTTGTGGATCCCTATATCCTCGAGGAGAA</elife:sequence>.
                Sequences like this should be tagged during pre-editing. This tagging will also
                increase discoverability of gene sequences in eLife articles.</p>
