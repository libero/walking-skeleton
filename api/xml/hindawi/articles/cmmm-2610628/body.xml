            <p>Breast cancer is one of the main causes of death among women and the most frequently
                diagnosed non-skin cancer in women [<a href="#B1">1</a>]. Breast cancer occurs when
                the cell tissues of the breast become abnormal and uncontrollably divided. These
                abnormal cells form large lump of tissues, which consequently becomes a tumor [<a
                    href="#B2">2</a>]. Such disorders could successfully be treated if they are
                detected early. Thus, it is of importance to have appropriate methods for screening
                the earliest signs of breast cancer.</p>
            <p>Microcalcifications and masses are the earliest signs of breast cancer which can only
                be detected using modern techniques. Microcalcifications are clusters of calcium
                deposits which are very small in size and present inside the soft breast tissues [<a
                    href="#B2">2</a>]. Generally, detection of masses in breast tissues is more
                challenging compared to the detection of microcalcifications, not only due to the
                large variation in size and shape but also because masses often exhibit poor image
                contrast when using mammography [<a href="#B3">3</a>]. The difficulty in
                classification of benign and malignant microcalcifications also causes a significant
                problem in medical image processing.</p>
            <p>Automated classifiers may be useful for radiologists in distinguishing between benign
                and malignant patterns. Thus, in this paper, an artificial neural network (ANN)
                which can be served as an automated classifier is investigated. In medical image
                processing, ANNs have been applied to a variety of data-classification and pattern
                recognition tasks and become a promising classification tool in breast cancer [<a
                    href="#B4">4</a>]. ANN applications in mammography, ultrasound, and MRI and IR
                imaging for early detection of breast cancer are reviewed in this paper.</p>
            <p>Image features can be distinguished in many aspects, such as texture, color, shape,
                and spatial relations. They can reflect the subtle variance in many degrees. Thus,
                different selections of image features will result in different classification
                decisions. These classifications can be divided into three types: first, the method
                based on statistics, such as Support Vector Machine; second, the method based on
                rule, such as decision tree and rough sets; and third, artificial neural network [<a
                    href="#B5">5</a>].</p>
            <p>In the early 1980s, there was an increment in the use of neural networks in the field
                of image and signal processing. The main benefit was the reduction in manipulation
                time due to the parallel-distributed processing behavior of neural networks [<a
                    href="#B6">6</a>]. Then the network had been used widely in the common image
                processing methods such as vector quantization, eigenvector extraction, 2D pulse
                code modulation, or 2D filtering [<a href="#B7">7</a>]. The artificial neural
                network resembles the function of the biological neuron, and it is composed of
                neurons with different layers and these neurons are interconnected by numeric
                weights; these weights can be changed due to the learning behavior of the network to
                approach the optimum result. Usually in image processing applications, the number of
                the neurons is directly related to the number of pixels in the input image [<a
                    href="#B8">8</a>], and the number of layers depends on the processing steps.</p>
            <p>For cancer detection and classification, image segmentation has been widely used.
                Many image segmentation methods, based on histogram features, edge detection, region
                growing, or pixel classification, have been trained using ANNs [<a href="#B9"
                >9</a>].</p>
            <p>Although the technology related to ANN in breast cancer detection has rapidly moved
                forward during the last few years, there is a dearth of critical literature review
                on the subject which is a distinct drawback for further development of the
                technologies. This paper is an attempt to fulfill that vacuum in the field of image
                processing in the early detection of breast cancer.</p>

                <title>2.1. Mammogram</title>
                <content>
                    <p>Mammography is one of the most effective methods used in hospitals and
                        clinics for early detection of breast cancer. It has been proven effective
                        to reduce mortality as much as by 30&#x25; [<a href="#B3">3</a>]. The main
                        objective of screening mammography is to early detect the cancerous tumor
                        and remove it before the establishment of metastases [<a href="#B3">3</a>,
                            <a href="#B10">10</a>, <a href="#B11">11</a>]. The early signs for
                        breast cancer are masses and microcalcification but the abnormalities and
                        normal breast tissues are often difficult to be differentiated due to their
                        subtle appearance and ambiguous margins [<a href="#B3">3</a>]. Only about
                        3&#x25; of the required information are revealed during a mammogram where a
                        part of suspicious region is covered with vessels and normal tissues. This
                        situation may cause the radiologists difficult to identify a cancerous
                        tumor. Thus, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has been developed to overcome
                        the limitation of mammogram and assists the radiologists to read the
                        mammograms much better [<a href="#B10">10</a>]. ANN model is the most
                        commonly used in CAD for mammography interpretation and biopsy decision
                        making. There are two ways used in ANN to assist in mammography
                        interpretation: first, applying classifier directly to the region of
                        interest (ROI) image data and second, understanding the situation from the
                        features extracted from the preprocessed image signals [<a href="#B12"
                            >12</a>]. Figure <a href="#fig1">1</a> shows an example of ANN structure
                        with multi-featured input data and multi-hidden layers [<a href="#B12"

                    <p>Microcalcification is deposition calcium in the soft breast tissues. They are
                        quite minute in quantity and size. It is found in a cluster or pattern of
                        circles/lines together with extra cell activity in breast region [<a
                            href="#B2">2</a>]. Many researchers have developed CAD system using
                        artificial neural network to detect microcalcification. In early
                        90&#x2019;s, research done by Dhawan et al. [<a href="#B13">13</a>] has
                        defined image structure features using the second-order grey-level
                        statistics. The classification was based on implementing perceptron based
                        3-layer neural network and the network uses backpropagation algorithm in
                        training which has been used successfully for a number of pattern
                        recognition and classification applications [<a href="#B13">13</a>, <a
                            href="#B14">14</a>]. The entropy feature has significant discriminating
                        power for classification [<a href="#B13">13</a>]. The group of researchers
                        further extended their research in investigating the potential of using
                        second-order histogram textural features for their correlation with
                        malignancy. Several architectures of neural networks were proposed to
                        analyze the features extracted from segmented calcifications and it shows
                        that the neural network gives good results for the classification of
                        hard-to-diagnoses cases of mammographic microcalcification into benign and
                        malignant categories using the selected set of features [<a href="#B15"
                            >15</a>].</p>
                    <p>Image segmentation is a technique used in image processing. Basically,
                        segmentation is performed on the raw image to detect small, local, and
                        bright spots. Research done by Kevin et al. [<a href="#B16">16</a>] has
                        drawn significant attention on the segmentation process and neural network
                        used. After segmentation process, ANN is performed to distinguish the
                        segmented objects called candidates, as either microcalcifications or
                        nonmicrocalcifications. The accuracy of the ANN is tested by having a set of
                        labelled test images for determination of true positive (TP) and false
                        positive (FP) detection rates. This ANN is using cascade correlation (CC)
                        for pattern classification. It is a self-organizing ANN which runs a
                        supervised learning algorithm. The CC ANN approach shows a promising result
                        to detect microcalcification [<a href="#B16">16</a>].</p>
                    <p>Not only image segmentation but also image registration techniques can be
                        used for the breast cancer detection where ANN is performed to enhance the
                        effectiveness of the cancer detection. In Saini and Vijay [<a href="#B17"
                            >17</a>], Grey-Level Cooccurrence Matrix (GLCM) features are extracted
                        and used as input to train artificial neural network based breast cancer
                        detection system. After that, the extracted features of known and unknown
                        mammogram images have been compared using feed-forward backpropagation and
                        Cascade forward backpropagation ANN to distinguish the malignant and benign
                        images. Feed-forward backpropagation network has high accuracy of 87.5&#x25;
                        compared to Cascade forward backpropagation network with 67.8&#x25; after
                        optimizing the number of neurons and number of layers [<a href="#B17"
                        >17</a>].</p>
                    <p>In late 90&#x2019;s, the application of ANN in CAD mammography was found to
                        have limitation in terms of data overfitting. Thus, Bayesian belief network
                        (BBN) was compared with ANN classification method to identify the positive
                        mass regions based on a set of computed features in CAD. The same database
                        was used in ANN and a BNN with topologies optimization using a genetic
                        algorithm (GA) to test the performance and robustness of the ANN and BBN.
                        However, the result shows that there is no significant difference between
                        using an ANN and using a BBN in CAD for mass detection if the network is
                        optimized properly [<a href="#B18">18</a>]. In Alayliogh and Aghdasi [<a
                            href="#B11">11</a>], wavelet-based image enhancement technique has been
                        used to improve the detection of breast cancer. Input feature vectors
                        containing spatial and spectral image were employed in neural network
                        classifier. Microcalcification detection scheme and wavelet image
                        enhancement have been investigated. Microcalcification detection has been
                        performed by using a multistage algorithm comprising the image segmentation
                        and pattern recognition to classify the microcalcifications whereas
                        biorthogonal spline wavelets have been used in image enhancement to separate
                        the image into frequency bands without affecting the spatial locality. The
                        result shows that spatial and spectral feature are promising ways to detect
                        microcalcification [<a href="#B11">11</a>].</p>
                    <p>Besides microcalcification, masses are the most important symptoms which are
                        difficult to be detected and distinguished accurately. A new algorithm based
                        on two ANNs (artificial neural networks) was proposed to detect these masses
                        automatically. ANFIS and multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier have been
                        used for adjustment and filtration. Suitable methods and parameters should
                        be applied to get high detection precision and low false positive (FP) [<a
                            href="#B10">10</a>]. The detection process was well adjusted and
                        improved with this proposed algorithm and the final diagnosis result showed
                        that the CAD scheme could simultaneously achieve comparatively high
                        detection precision and low false positive rate, even when the special
                        masses are dealt with [<a href="#B10">10</a>].</p>
                    <p>In mammography equipped with CAD system, the major problems developed are
                        inconsistency and low classification accuracy. The accuracy can be improved
                        by introducing a novel intelligent classifier which used texture information
                        as input for the classification of normal and abnormal tissues in
                        mammograms. Dheeba et al. [<a href="#B3">3</a>] used neutral network as a
                        new artificial intelligent technique for the tissue classification. CAD
                        system based on the optimized wavelet neural network was designed and
                        evaluated using Particle Swarm Optimization approach (PSOWNN). Optimization
                        using heuristic algorithm is done to find appropriate hidden neurons,
                        momentum constant, and learning rate during the training process. Thus, it
                        will improve the classification accuracy in breast cancer detection by
                        reducing the misclassification rate [<a href="#B3">3</a>]. In Zhang et al.
                            [<a href="#B19">19</a>], backpropagation neural network (BPNN) is
                        introduced for the classification of benign and malignant. The digitized
                        mammogram used fuzzy detection algorithm to detect the microcalcification
                        and suspicious area. BPNN gives a very promising result with 83.3&#x25; for
                        the classification [<a href="#B19">19</a>].</p>
                    <p>Any defect in breast image obtained from mammogram is highly advantageous to
                        be detected automatically. In Lashkari [<a href="#B20">20</a>], Gabor
                        wavelets and ANN are used to classify normal and abnormal tissues which
                        could increase the accuracy and save radiologist&#x2019;s time (Figure <a
                            href="#fig2">2</a>). Gabor wavelets transforms have a good attribute in
                        image processing and computer vision. The result shows that this combination
                        of neural networks has a good potential with 97&#x25; accuracy on unknown
                        cases [<a href="#B20">20</a>].</p>

                <content>
                    <p>Neural network (NN) also plays its role in ultrasound images in detecting
                        breast cancer. We will first look into the capability of NN in determining
                        and recognizing a region where malignant and benign lesions can be found.
                        Buller [<a href="#B21">21</a>] was one of the first who used neural network
                        in breast cancer detection for ultrasound images. In his work, he separated
                        the training process for benign and malignant cases by feeding the first
                        system only with images containing benign lesion and the other with images
                        containing only malignant lesion. He also introduces &#x201c;spider
                        web&#x201d; topology which are able to produce two vectors that are further
                        used in the classification process. The first vector represent the localized
                        effects in a defined neighborhood and the other represents the global
                        attributes. The technique brings high advantages as the spider web topology
                        is sensitive to small area and hence provides better results in small area
                        by putting more weights on the localized effects. This technique can
                        actually be improved taking into account the extra parameters of texture and
                        shape. As we know, malign and benign lesion has slightly different texture
                        and shape. In Ruggierol et al. [<a href="#B22">22</a>], the researchers
                        implement the NN using both texture and shape parameters. Transition
                        probability matrix and Run length matrix on the texture parameter have been
                        used to quantify the homogeneity of images while shape parameter shows the
                        irregularity of border of lesion. Besides, three-layer NN consisting of
                        input, output, and hidden neurons was used. They also execute the training
                        process by leaving one out before training and use the left out as tester.
                        From the result, texture implementation achieved a very good result on both
                        solid and liquid lesion.</p>
                    <p>Classification is an important technique used widely to differentiate
                        cancerous and noncancerous breasts. Denser breast has higher risk in having
                        cancer. Knowing this, Sahiner et al. [<a href="#B23">23</a>] in their paper
                        describe the importance of texture images in classification of dense breast
                        tissue. They also introduce convolution neural network classifier to replace
                        the backpropagation methods where the images are fed directly into the
                        network. To measure the coarseness of texture, grey-level difference
                        statistics and features are used, whereas spatial grey-level dependence
                        features will be showing the element distribution. The strength of this
                        method is that no image of tumor is fed into the network. Besides,
                        segmentation does not need to be performed beforehand; instead a threshold
                        value will be used. The drawback is the high computational cost which in
                        turn makes the technique probably unsuitable for real-time operation.</p>
                    <p>As early as 1999, NN classifier has been used with autocorrelation features
                        to classify the breast cancer as benign or malignant. Chen et al. [<a
                            href="#B24">24</a>] introduced a 25-input node multilayer feed-forward
                        NN which consists of 24-dimensional image feature vector from the ultrasound
                        image, together with a predefined threshold of the input layer to classify
                        the cancer. The introduced system has a relatively high accuracy in
                        classifying malignancies and thus could help inexperienced operators to
                        diagnose complicated ultrasound images. One of the striking advantages of NN
                        is that it could be further optimized by supplying larger set of ultrasound
                        images as the NN is well-trainable.</p>
                    <p>Self-organizing map (SOM) model is one type of neural networks that can be
                        trained without supervision; it is widely used as a classifier in recent
                        years. It expresses lower dimensional data in a simple geometry compared
                        with the complex high dimensional data such as that in Chen et al. [<a
                            href="#B25">25</a>]. SOM training is fairly easy as a desired output is
                        not necessary. SOM will automatically choose the closest input vector. The
                        classification of benign and malignant lesion is automated. The only
                        training needed is the data from texture analysis. However, its accuracy is
                        slightly lower than that of the multilayer feed-forward NN introduced by
                        Chen et al. [<a href="#B24">24</a>] previously. With a high negative
                        predictive value of 98&#x25;, this CAD technique of SOM could potentially
                        avoid benign biopsies. In the same year, Chen et al. [<a href="#B26">26</a>]
                        came out with a HNN diagnostic system. The texture information features are
                        extracted from four ultrasound images. The 2D normalized autocorrelation
                        matrix for the input is modified and 2-phase HNN was used to combine the
                        texture information from all of the ultrasound images. This study proves
                        that the use of all 4 images leads to a more promising result than the case
                        where images are used separately.</p>
                    <p>Bootstrap is a statistical measure that relies on random sampling with
                        replacement. Combination of bootstrap technique with neural network helps
                        improve the accuracy. Chen et al. [<a href="#B27">27</a>] implement
                        bootstrap to perform random sampling; the observation was then recomputed.
                        This technique is useful where large amount of training data is not
                        available, as it does not require much training data. However, the reduced
                        amount of data should be compensated by adding image analysis component, in
                        the bootstrap method.</p>
                    <p>The research done in 2002 used error backpropagation algorithm to train the
                        multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) and resulted in an area index
                        of the receiver operating curve (ROC) of <mml:math

                        morphological features have been introduced to differentiate benign from
                        malignant breast lesions with the use of MPNN [<a href="#B29">29</a>]. The
                        morphological features were named as lobulation index (LI),
                        elliptic-normalized skeleton (ENS), elliptic-normalized circumference (ENC),
                        depth to width ratio (D&#x2009;:&#x2009;W), long axis to short axis
                        (L&#x2009;:&#x2009;S), number of substantial protuberances and depressions
                        (NSPD), and the size of lesion. The MPLNN is also tested with different
                        number of hidden neurons but all results lead to a similar performance.
                        Accuracy of the training set and test set is better than SOM and MLP NN with
                        three inputs but on par with the accuracy of NN with 25 autocorrelation
                        features as inputs. Different inputs selected and number of inputs may have
                        an impact on the accuracy of the NN itself regardless of any types of NN
                        techniques.</p>
                    <p>A year later, a research tested the NN by using only 5 morphological features
                        which are the spiculation, branch pattern, ellipsoid shape, brightness of
                        nodule, and the number of lobulations [<a href="#B30">30</a>, <a href="#B31"
                            >31</a>]. Based on these morphological features, the difference of
                        characteristics between the benign and malignant could be seen as

                <content>
                    <p>Thermal imaging has been used for early identification of breast tumor and
                        risk prediction since the 60s [<a href="#B33">33</a>]. Thermogram is a
                        promising cutting edge screening instrument as it can caution ladies of
                        breast malignancy up to 10 years ahead of time [<a href="#B34">34</a>]. Some
                        studies have utilized several types of ANNs to manipulate and classify IR
                        images, by taking the IR image as an input to the ANN [<a href="#B35"
                        >35</a>]. In 2003, multispectral IR images were classified using Lagrange
                        Constraint Neural Network (LCNN) which provides a better diagnosis for the
                        physician [<a href="#B36">36</a>]. Wavelet transformation is also useful
                        with ANN for multidimensional features of the IR image, especially when it
                        was found that the temperature of the breast is affected by many
                        pathological factors including the mental state [<a href="#B37">37</a>].
                        Asymmetry discrimination between left and right breasts can be done to
                        produce statistical features such as mean temperature and standard deviation
                        that could be utilized as info parameters to a backpropagation ANN [<a
                            href="#B33">33</a>]. In 2007, thermographic image analysis was done by
                        implementing a special neural network that utilizes some fuzzy logic
                        principles, called Complementary Learning Fuzzy Neural Network (CLFNN).
                        CLFNN takes many factors into account such as family history and temperature
                        difference of the statistical features between contralateral breasts [<a

                        used in MR image segmentation to estimate the density of the breast regions

        <content>
            <p>For the last few decades, several computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) techniques have been
                developed in mammographic examination of breast cancer to assist radiologist in
                overall image analysis and to highlight suspicious areas that need further
                attention. It can help radiologist to find a tumor which cannot be spotted using
                naked eye. As technologies keep growing, many researchers are concerned about the
                development of intelligent techniques which can be used in mammography to improve
                the classification accuracy. This artificial intelligence makes use of human skills
                in a more efficient manner than the conventional mathematical models do. Based on
                the research outcomes, ANN is proved to be a good classifier in mammography for
                classification of masses and microcalcifications. Implementation perceptron based
                three-layer neural network using backpropagation algorithm becomes a pioneer in ANN
                mammography. Various ANNs developed are based on the concept of increasing the true
                positive (TP) detection rate and decreasing the false positive (FP) and false
                negative (FN) detection rate for the optimum result. Implementation of wavelet in
                ANNs such as Particle Swarm Optimized Wavelet Neural Network (PSOWNN), biorthogonal
                spline wavelet ANN, second-order grey-level ANN, and Gabor wavelets ANN can improve
                the sensitivity and specificity which are acquired in masses and microcalcification
                detection.</p>
            <p>For ultrasound applications, in the field of determining breast cancer malignancy,
                CAD frameworks utilizing ultrasound images are widely used due to their nonradiation
                properties, low cost, high availability, speedier results, and higher accuracy. An
                improved version of the breast cancer detection using ultrasound images has been
                introduced, which works on a three-dimensional ultrasound imaging that can give more
                in-depth information on the breast lesion compared to the conventional
                two-dimensional imaging. This three-dimensional imaging joins each of the
                two-dimensional characteristics. Furthermore, in order to handle the vulnerability
                nature of the ultrasound images, some methods and methodologies based on ANN have
                also been introduced. A majority of the research works that utilize ANN have
                acquired noteworthy results. Hybrid methods, which combine two ANN techniques, have
                recently been developed for the detection and classification of breast cancer. A
                two-phase hierarchical NN is also found to be promising rather than using the image
                analysis separately. It can also be seen that the larger the number of inputs to the
                ANN, the better the accuracy of the output in identification and classification of
                breast cancer. However, the number of hidden neurons does not seem to have a big
                impact on the accuracy of the system. To state which individual ANN is the best is
                quite subjective depending on the application and various variables to be
                considered. Most of the ANN techniques for the ultrasound application give good
                results in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value,
                and negative predictive value. Another advantage of using the ANN in determining
                breast lesion is that the ANN can be trained to produce better accuracy. Besides
                that, this ANN can be combined together with not only another ANN technique but also
                other signal processing techniques such as wavelet to produce better results.</p>
            <p>For different techniques that have been utilized for the breast cancer imaging, there
                are different methods of detection and classification according to the input
                parameters of that technique. For the IR imaging, it has been shown that the
                detection of the breast cancer depends mainly on the statistical features of the
                thermal behavior of the tissues (mean, standard deviation, etc.), as well as the
                asymmetry differentiation of the contralateral breasts. Therefore, image
                classification methods based on ANN are quite fruitful in thermography.</p>
            <p>The MRI imaging is highly recognized as a reliable technique for tumor localization
                as well as early detection and classification of cancer, as it is generally
                recommended for soft tissue recognition. Many image segmentation and 3D extraction
                algorithms are applied in MRI applications, and recently, many ANN classification
                types have been designed with many fine specifications for MRI breast imaging.</p>

            <p>Neural network plays an important role in detection of carcinogenic conditions in the
                breast. The technique acts as a stepping stone in the detection of cancer. In this
                review, we show that NN can be used in many medical applications which we
                categorized into four main medical applications that are widely used in breast
                cancer detection. These four medical applications include mammogram, ultrasound, and
                thermal and MRI imaging. This shows that NN is not restricted by the
                application.</p>
            <p>In all applications, NN&#x2019;s main purposes were automated classification and
                segmentation. The types of data that need to be classified include calcification and
                noncalcification, benign and malignant, dense and normal breast, and tumorous and
                nontumorous. Neural network needs training data. Different types of data are fed
                into NN for training purposes. In early adaptation of NN, images of breast are being
                fed directly into the NN. This method will perform well only if very large databases
                are available. In the case of using such huge data, the concern was the storage, the
                time of performance, and the data availability. This flaw was realized and being
                improved by taking the ROI into account, which lowered the amount of dataset
                requirement tremendously. Researcher were then able to come out with better ideas
                where they now train the NN with feature vectors. In our findings, the features that
                can be used as training data include spiculation, branch pattern, shape, brightness
                of nodule, number of lobulations, margin, size of nodule, granularity, and texture.
                These features can be extracted manually or using image analysis technique.
                Introducing of features did improve the performance of NN in terms of size of
                training data and accuracy.</p>
            <p>Different variation of NN can be applied as classifier. Feed-forward backpropagation
                NN is by far the simplest form of NN, as the name suggest, the input nodes do not
                have interrelation between each other, and more importantly, the units do not form a
                repetitive cycle or loops. Feed-forward backpropagation can only pass data from
                current layer to subsequent layer; hence the data is moving in one fix direction
                from input to output. Cascade forward NNs are somehow similar to feed-forward NNs;
                the only difference is that they include connections from not only the input, but
                also every previous layer to the subsequent layers. Convolution NN is considered as
                a special type of feed-forward neural network where there are multiple layers of
                small neuron collections that are able to process the portions of input image.</p>
            <p>The trend now is going towards hybrid NN like SOM model. Combination of statistical
                methods such as bootstrap is being used together with NN too. SOM and bootstrap
                methods require lesser training data and hence are useful when we do not have many
                training data. Besides, people utilize SVM with NN in order to achieve a better
                performance. In conclusion, NN is widely used in medical image applications,
                creatively combined with other methods in order to achieve better accuracy,
                sensitivity, and also positive predictive value.</p>
