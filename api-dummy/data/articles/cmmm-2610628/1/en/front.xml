        <p>We study a simple coordination problem to understand the difference between
            centralized and decentralized economic systems. The decentralized system is more robust than the
            centralized system to communication errors. But the centralized system takes less time than the
            decentralized system to create coordination among constituent parts. Decentralization is preferable
            when the constituent parts are more likely to make communication errors, when there is little
            urgency, and when there is need to prevent system-collapse.</p>
